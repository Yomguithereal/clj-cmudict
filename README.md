# clj-cmudict

*clj-cmudict* is a simple wrapper for the [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict).

## Installation
To install the lastest version from [clojars](https://clojars.org/), just add the following vector to the `:dependencies` section of your `project.clj` file.

```clj
[clj-cmudict "0.2.0"]
```

To install the latest version from the current source, clone the repository and install with leiningen.

```
git clone https://github.com/Yomguithereal/clj-cmudict.git
cd clj-cmudict
lein install
```

Then include the same vector within your `project.clj` and you should be good to go.

**N.B.** The library is quite heavy for it encapsulates the cmudict as a whole an is not an API client.

## Usage

To get the arpabet code of a single word

```clj
(use 'clj-cmudict.core)

(first (arpabet "shine"))
(:SH :AY1 :N)

 The arpabet function returns a vector of possibilities
(arpabet "pronunciation")
[(:P :R :OW0 :N :AH2 :N :S :IY0 :EY1 :SH :AH0 :N)
 (:P :R :AH0 :N :AH2 :N :S :IY0 :EY1 :SH :AH0 :N)]
```
